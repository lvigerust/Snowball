                <p class="article-text">It can take 15 to 1000 years before the plastic bag you used for a couple minutes are broken down in the environment. Don't ask for a new plastic bag every time you go shopping, especially when you're just shopping a few groceries. <br> <br> These plastic bags will live longer than all of us combined and way to often it ends up being digested by wildlife or tangled around marine animals. <br> <br> The <span>best option</span> is to get yourself a reusable bag and if you really want to make a difference, contact your most used brands and corporations and encourage them to make more sustainable plastic-free choices. </p>
