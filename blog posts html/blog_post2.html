            <p class="article-text">
                An affordable, luxurious all-inclusive voyage on the ocean, visiting the most beautiful places, on a huge ship with everything you
                could possible need. Going to sleep after
                a day packed with entertainment and food, only to wake up at the shores of a new country, with new
                exciting experiences. Sounds like the perfect escape from every day life.<br><br>

                But to the environment, the cruise industry is a everything but beautiful.
                During a typical one-week voyage, a large cruise ship (with 3,000 passengers and crew) is estimated to generate 210,000 gallons of sewage;
                1 million gallons of graywater (wastewater from sinks, showers, and laundries);
                more than 130 gallons of hazardous wastes; 8 tons of solid waste; and 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water.<br><br>
                The air pollution in the European seas alone 10 times more disease-causing sulphur dioxide than
                all of Europeâ€™s 260+ million passenger vehicles.

                We want to impose strict regulations for waste management, informational campaigns,
                and to reach our end goal of ending the industry.
